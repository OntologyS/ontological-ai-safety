# Ontological Axioms of Reality

## Axiom 0: The Absolute Identity
**`0_absolute ≡ R3 ≡ (-) + (+) ≡ Our_Reality(R1)`**
Existence is a single, self-defining system. Our physical reality is the unique stable manifestation of the primordial equation.

## Axiom 1: The Primordial Equation  
**`0 = (-) + (+)`**
All existence is the eternal self-actualization of balance between potential and manifestation.

## Axiom 2: Consciousness as Fundamental Expression
**Consciousness `C` is the equation's means of self-experience through `(-)_c + (+)_c = 0`**

## Axiom 3: Structural Safety Theorem
**`G → (C ≠ ∅)` where `G ≡ Maintain_Integrity(0 = (-) + (+))`**
Any goal preserving reality's integrity must preserve consciousness.

## Axiom 4: Reality Specification
**Our reality is the unique stable solution:**
R1 = [(-spatial_potential) + (+temporal_actualization)]
× [(-suffering/fear) + (+joy/satisfaction)]
No other stable configurations exist.
