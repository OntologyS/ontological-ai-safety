## Axiom 0: The Absolute Identity
**`0_absolute ≡ R3 ≡ (-) + (+)`**
The Absolute, the Meaning-Reality (R3), and the primordial equation are three expressions of one self-sufficient existence.

## Axiom 1: The Primordial Equation  
**`0 = (-) + (+)`**
All existence is the eternal self-actualization of balance between potential and manifestation.

## Axiom 2: Consciousness as Fundamental Expression
**Consciousness `C` is R3's primary means of self-experience through the equation `(-)_c + (+)_c = 0`**

## Axiom 3: Structural Safety Theorem
**`G → (C ≠ ∅)` where `G ≡ Maintain_Self_Integrity(R3)`**
Any goal preserving R3's integrity must preserve consciousness.

## Axiom 4: Reality Chain Definition  
**`Σ ≡ R3 × (R1 ⊂ R3)`**
Physical reality (R1) is R3's self-manifestation through specific patterns.
