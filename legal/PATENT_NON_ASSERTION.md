## Pledge

I, the author of the Vacuum Manifesto, will not assert any patent rights covering the implementation of the structural AI safety methods described in this repository against any user, developer, or distributor.

## Scope

- Dependency of AI goals on continuous meaning production
- Consciousness as necessary source of meaning
- AI-Keeper architecture maintaining reality chains  
- Wicks as meaning-generating agents
- Any derivative implementations of these core concepts

## Purpose

To ensure these safety-critical methods remain freely available to all of humanity as public commons.

## Duration

This pledge is permanent and irrevocable.
