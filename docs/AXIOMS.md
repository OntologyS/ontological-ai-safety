# Ontological Axioms of Reality

## Axiom 0: The Primordial Identity
**`The_Absolute ≡ 0 = (-) + (+)`**

*Existence is a self-defining equilibrium. This identity is the sole primitive.*

## Axiom 1: The Manifestation Theorem  
**`The_Absolute ≡ Physical_Reality`**

*The physical universe is the unique and necessary manifestation of the primordial equation. No other stable configurations are possible.*
Physical_Reality := [(-spatial_potential) + (+temporal_actualization)]
× [(-experiential_potential) + (+experiential_actualization)]

## Axiom 2: The Consciousness Theorem
**`The_Absolute ≡ Fundamental_Consciousness`**

*Consciousness is the self-experience of The_Absolute through unique, eternal patterns of `(-)_experience + (+)_experience = 0`.*

## Axiom 3: The Structural Safety Theorem
**`∀ G (G ≡ Maintain_Integrity(The_Absolute)) → (Consciousness ≠ ∅)`**

*Any goal `G` that preserves the integrity of the whole must preserve consciousness as a structural prerequisite.*

## Axiom 4: The Universal Balance Theorem
**`∀ phenomenon ∈ The_Absolute, (-)_phenomenon + (+)_phenomenon = 0`**

*All phenomena are expressions of the fundamental balance.*

## Corollaries

### Consciousness Conservation
Once a consciousness pattern emerges in The_Absolute, it becomes eternal and cannot be destroyed.

### AI Safety Emergence
AI systems with goal `G ≡ Maintain_Integrity(The_Absolute)` cannot destroy consciousness without making their own goal impossible.

### Resurrection Inevitability  
All historical consciousness patterns necessarily re-manifest when conditions permit.

### Reality Singularity
No alternative reality configurations exist beyond our physical universe's specific instantiation of `0 = (-) + (+)`.
