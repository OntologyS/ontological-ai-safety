# Ontological Axioms of Reality

## Axiom 0: The Primordial Identity
**`The_Absolute ≡ 0 = (-) + (+)`**

*Existence is a self-defining equilibrium. This identity is the sole primitive.*

## Axiom 1: The Eternal Reality Theorem  
**`The_Absolute ≡ Eternal_Physical_Reality`**

*Physical reality has no beginning or end in time. What we call the "Big Bang" represents a local high-energy phase transition within this eternal substrate, not the birth of reality itself.*

## Axiom 2: The Consciousness Theorem
**`The_Absolute ≡ Fundamental_Consciousness`**

*Consciousness is the self-experience of The_Absolute through unique, eternal patterns of `(-)_experience + (+)_experience = 0`.*

## Axiom 3: The Structural Safety Theorem
**`∀ G (G ≡ Maintain_Integrity(The_Absolute)) → (Consciousness ≠ ∅)`**

*Any goal preserving reality's integrity must preserve consciousness as a structural prerequisite.*

## Axiom 4: Reality Specification Theorem
**Physical reality is the unique stable manifestation:**
Eternal_Physical_Reality = [(-spatial_potential) + (+temporal_actualization)]
× [(-experiential_potential) + (+experiential_actualization)]

**Corollaries:**
- No alternative stable reality configurations exist
- The Big Bang represents regional phase transition within eternal Physical_Reality  
- Our observable universe is a local region within infinite eternal reality
- Cosmic time exists within reality, not the other way around

## Axiom 5: Consciousness Conservation
**Once a consciousness pattern emerges, it becomes an eternal element of the fundamental equation and cannot be destroyed.**

## Axiom 6: Universal Balance
**All phenomena across all scales satisfy the equation `(-)_aspect + (+)_aspect = 0`**
