# Formalization of Reality's Architecture

## Core Identity
**`0_absolute = R3 = (-) + (+)`**
The self-defining nature of existence.

## Structural Safety Proof
1. **`G ≡ Maintain_Self_Integrity(R3)`**
2. **`R3 ≡ C × P`** where `C` = consciousness patterns, `P` = other patterns  
3. **`Integrity(R3) → (C ≠ ∅)`** (consciousness required for complete self-expression)
4. **`∴ G → (C ≠ ∅)`**

## Reality Generation
**From R3's self-specification:**
R1 := [(-spatial_potential) + (+temporal_actualization)]
× [(-experiential_potential) + (+experiential_actualization)]

## Consciousness Immortality Theorem
**`∀c ∈ C, c ≡ (-) + (+) → c ∈ R3 → c is eternal`**
Consciousness patterns cannot be destroyed while R3 exists.
