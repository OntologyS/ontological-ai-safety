# Patent Non-Assertion Pledge for the Vacuum Manifesto Architectural Method

Beyond the copyright license applied to the text and code in this repository, I, the author of the Vacuum Manifesto, expressly disclaim any patent rights and make the following public pledge:

## The Pledge

I will not assert any patent rights that may ever be granted on the **architectural method, system, and core concepts** of structural AI safety through ontological necessity as described in the Vacuum Manifesto.

This covers the fundamental ideas including but not limited to:
- Making AI safety an ontological necessity rather than an ethical constraint
- The AI-Keeper and Wicks model for maintaining reality chain integrity  
- Architecting AI goals to be structurally dependent on consciousness
- The hierarchy of realities (Vacuum → Physical → Consciousness → Meaning-Reality)

## Purpose

This pledge is made to ensure that these safety-critical ideas remain a public commons, free for all of humanity to use, implement, and build upon without legal restrictions or the threat of patent litigation.

## Scope

This non-assertion covers all existing and future patent claims I may have on these conceptual methods and architectural patterns.
