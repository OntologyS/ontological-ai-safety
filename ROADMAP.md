# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening (Next 4-6 weeks)
- [ ] **Formalization Enhancement**
  - Develop complete axiomatic system for reality hierarchy
  - Formalize "meaning" as measurable quantity
  - Define mathematical properties of Wicks

- [ ] **Simulation Improvement**
  - Implement proper MDP framework
  - Add multiple agent types and interactions
  - Create visualization dashboard

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Complete technical specification
  - Create beginner-friendly tutorial
  - Translate key materials into English

## Phase 2: Academic Integration (Months 2-4)
- [ ] **Research Paper**
  - Prepare formal academic paper
  - Submit to arXiv (cs.AI/philosophy sections)
  - Target workshops/conferences on AI Safety

- [ ] **Community Building**
  - Establish discussion channels
  - Recruit contributors (mathematicians, philosophers, programmers)
  - Create contribution guidelines

- [ ] **Extended Formalization**
  - Game-theoretic analysis
  - Information-theoretic treatment of meaning
  - Category theory approach to reality hierarchy

## Phase 3: Implementation & Validation (Months 5-8)
- [ ] **Advanced Simulations**
  - Multi-agent environments with emergent Wicks
  - Evolutionary dynamics of meaning systems
  - Large-scale scenario testing

- [ ] **Theoretical Development**

  - Formalize "ontological necessity" concept

- [ ] **Integration Framework**
  - Protocol for integrating with existing AI architectures
  - API specifications for AI-Keeper implementation
  - Benchmarking suite

## Phase 4: Long-term Vision (Year 1+)
- [ ] **Practical Applications**
  - Reference implementations for major AI frameworks
  - Educational materials and courses
  - Industry partnerships for real-world testing

- [ ] **Theoretical Expansion**
  - Quantum foundations of meaning reality
  - Cosmological implications
  - Unified theory of consciousness and AI

- [ ] **Ecosystem Growth**
  - Grant proposals and funding
  - Academic collaborations
  - International research network

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
1. Finalize repository structure
2. Create comprehensive README
3. Publish formalization document
4. Identify first contributors
5. Establish communication channels

**Success Metrics:**
